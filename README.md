# Code for the paper "Digital measurement of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from 7 million contacts"
Repo for publicly shareable code for the publication "Digital measurement of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from 7 million contacts" (Ferretti & Wymant et al, Nature, 2023, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06952-2).

The main analysis can be run by launching the script *mock_configuration.R* (replacing the configuration therein with the appropriate configuration) then launching *RunMainAnalyses.R*.

Running the secondary analyses for the paper (*generate_statistics_for_paper_risk.R* and *plots_for_paper_risk.R*) can be very slow due to the Maximum Likelihood analyses.

Data not included in this repo. See the original publication for details on data access.
